Feel a deeper union 
with the people around you 

by: 
1. remembering what you really care for
2. crystallizing it with the magic of mobile technology
3. transmitting it to those near you

After that, you will either:
- Be approached by one who can help you fulfill that vision
- Know who can help you fulfill that vision, by looking at the window to the universe that is your smart device. Go find them!

So that you:
- receive help from people you may not have considered that could enrich your life 
- see your life in many more dimensions than just survival and pleasure, and try to supply deeper needs accordingly,
- can be clear about your deeper desires instead of being pushed by othersâ€™ expectations, 
- blur the lines between giving and receiving help, which may help uncover a deeper reality than the apparent separation we experience.

This pair of free apps in development use Bluetooth to send information to mobile devices near yours without needing to pair them beforehand, via a newer version of the protocol called Bluetooth Low Energy which is most probably already in your device. It is currently only available for Android devices, but an iOS version is coming.

You can get a working, test version from the Google Drive reachable via this short URL:
