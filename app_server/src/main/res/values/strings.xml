    <string name="about">About this app\n\nWe hope this app reminds you of the magic that is already out there in the world. As you use it, we invite you to allow yourself to:
        \n- Receive help from someone you may not have considered that could enrich your life.
        \n- See your life in many more dimensions than just survival and pleasure.
\n- Fulfill different needs than the ones you have already covered (i.e. don\'t continuously fulfill the same one/s).
        \n- Be clear about your deeper desires instead of being pushed by expectations.
\n- Blur the lines between giving and receiving help, which may help discover a deeper reality than the apparent separation we experience. In other words, be open to what you might receive when you feel you are giving, and open yourself to noticing the flavor your life takes when you feel grateful for the help you receive.
        \nEnjoy!

It is inside a text input field, so that you can easily copy it. Just hold your finger over the code, and select "Copy". You can also type it. If you want to scan for matches (receive matches), instead of advertising your data (outputting your data), please copy the text below, input it in the companion scanning app, and let it scan. We should aim for having roughly half the people advertising and half scanning at any given moment in time. This will be made easier to use in future versions of this app. Only a person scanning can receive matches from people advertising, so people can alternate scanning and advertising after some time. The data below only gets updated when you start advertising, so you can advertise shortly if you want to update it. If you see this character \"0\", it is the number zero, not the letter O.\n</string>
